Stories of modeling gone well and gone wrong.

Define:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Training model, production model
\end{itemize}

Tell stories about:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Newton's model for planetary motion
  \item Interpretability is more important than precision (story of black Scholes)
  \item Simplicity is more important than precision (Netflix story)
  \item Those who don't understand the math are doomed to use black boxes
  \item Your training model should be as close as possible to your production model (MBS modeling)
\end{itemize}

General remarks on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Segregating data into training/cv/test sets
  \item Variable selection
  \item Transforming variables and why a linear-only model isn't enough
\end{itemize}



\section{End Notes}

The chapter title is a play on \emph{Models.Behaving.Badly}, by Emanuel Derman.  This book goes into much detail about the distinction between models and theory.
