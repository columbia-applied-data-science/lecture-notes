notes/ contains random notes that are not maintained or published

latex/appdatasci.tex is the "main" file for the book.  Compile this.  It will use the other tex files such as unix.tex.


Style

We need to find a nice template.  Currently I'm using the standard latex book class.  The latex class memoir class provides lots of flexibility, but it is difficult to figure out how to tweak it.  There are probably examples available online.

We could roughly follow Springer's [advice](http://www.springer.com/authors/book+authors?SGWID=0-154102-0-0-0) for writing books.
