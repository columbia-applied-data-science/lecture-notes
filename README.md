# Lecture Notes #

This repository contains lecture notes for Columbia University's *Applied Data Science* [course](http://columbia-applied-data-science.github.io/) taught in the spring of 2013. The lecture notes are in LaTeX/TeX.

## Disclaimers ##

* This is not a book but lecture notes, i.e. it is inherently incomplete and has never been edited. 
* There are likely typos and no guarantee that code samples will run in modern systems or versions.
* These notes primarily form a collection of instructions on how to do certain things. In particular, they represent the basic tool-set of what in 2013 could be described as a "data scientist," and some background on those tools.
* If you want to get up and running hacking with statistical models they provide one starting point.
* They are not explanations of why those things work, why it makes sense to do them and when, or what computing and machines *learning* is all about. They are akin to a technical music lesson which walks you the basics of playing *Golberg's Variations* with no mention of music, what that particular piece of music conveys, or of Bach himself. 
* Finally, these notes represent the authors' views in 2013, very early in their carreer, which do not necessarily transfer to the present day.
